* #### **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING**

  * I am also an experienced and proud competitive programmer ([What is competitive programming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)).

  * Offline contests:  In high school, I was a two-time silver medalist of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (both in 2017 and 2018). During undergrad, representing Tsinghua University, I won a gold prize in ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Yinchuan Regional, a silver prize in ICPC East Asia Continental Final of, and 2 gold prizes in CCPC (Chinese Collegiate Programming Contest). For now, representing Princeton University, I won an overall third place and bronze medal in ICPC Greater New York Regional 2023 and advanced to ICPC North America Continental Championship 2024.

  * For online contests, I rank 16/182781 worldwide (and 2nd in China) on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) ([leaderboard here](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard)).  I also compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) ([see my profile here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marco_L_T)) and [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/) ([see my profile here](https://csacademy.com/user/Marco_L_T)).

  * Besides, I'm also an experienced problem setter for competitive programming contests. I have set and tested a number of problems for various contests. For example, I'm the main author of [Codeforces Round #447](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55858) ([problemset here](https://codeforces.com/contest/894)) and a problem setter of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021. Here is the problem I set ([original version in Chinese](https://uoj.ac/problem/676), [English translation](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/25068)). 

    

* #### **SOCIAL WORK**

  * I was gratefully elected and served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress at Tsinghua University for 2022-23 academic year, and I was the vice president and deputy secretary the year before.

  * I'm a member of the Algorithm Association at Tsinghua University. And I served as the problem setter and coordinator of a number of contests (including National Olympiad in Informatics (2021), Tsinghua University Programming Contest (2020, 2021, 2022)).

  * I was a volunteer for the 110th anniversary of Tsinghua University.

    

* #### AVOCATION

  * Fan of NBA, Formula 1, and European Soccer. My favorite sporting stars include Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors, NBA), Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes, F1), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari, F1), and Marco Reus (BVB Dortmund, Bundesliga). 
  
  * Amateur yet enthusiastic player of Geoguessr and HugeQuiz (especially in geography and sports).
  
  * Fan of stand-up comedies (including both Chinese-style cross-talk and American-style talk shows) and musicals. My favorite musicals include "Hamilton" and "Les Miserables".
  
  * Fan of music, especially those in musicals or in "Gu-Feng" (ancient Chinese) style.
  
  * I am also fond of playing basketball, although I don't have strong skills and can't often win a game :(
