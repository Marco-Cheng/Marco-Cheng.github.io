 * My research interests include blockchain, generative AI, mechanism and incentive design, and applied cryptography.

  * Since sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/) to conduct scientific research on blockchain at Tsinghua University, and it's the initiation and enlightenment of my stepping into scientific research. 
  
  During this period, I completed a research project: [Game Theoretical Analysis of Multiple Selfish Mining on Blockchains](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/project/game-theoretical-analysis-of-selfish-mining-in-blockchain/), and my first academic research paper: [Crowdsourcing Work as Mining: A Decentralized Computation and Storage Paradigm](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/papers/crowdsourcing-work-as-mining-a-decentralized-computing-paradigm/).

  * I was fortunate to be invited to serve as a reviewer for [IEEE JSAC Special Issue (Intelligent Blockchain) 2022](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-jsac/cfp/intelligent-blockchain-future-communications-and-networking).

  * I was fortunate to be accepted as a research intern on blockchain in the spring and summer of 2022, advised by [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhang.me) at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) at the University of California, Berkeley. 
  
  I carried out research on two projects during the internship. One was the analysis and simulation of side contracts against EIP-1559 in Ethereum, and the other was the design and implementation of cross-chain bridge protocols (the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560652) was accepted to ACM CCS 2022 and it's my first-ever publication).

  * The list of published papers and their details are attached below.
