  * My research interests are genearlly within the scope of blockchains. I used to do research from the perspective mechanism design and applied cryptography, and now I'm exploring how to equip blockchains with the recent incredible advances in generative AI under the guidance of [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath).<br/>

  * Since sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/) to conduct scientific research on blockchain at Tsinghua University, and it's the initiation and enlightenment of my stepping into scientific research. During this period, I completed a research project: [Game Theoretical Analysis of Multiple Selfish Mining on Blockchains](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/project/game-theoretical-analysis-of-selfish-mining-in-blockchain/), and my first academic research paper: [Crowdsourcing Work as Mining: A Decentralized Computation and Storage Paradigm](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/papers/crowdsourcing-work-as-mining-a-decentralized-computing-paradigm/).<br/>

  * I was fortunate to be accepted as a research intern in the spring and summer of 2022, advised by [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhang.me) at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I carried out research on two projects during the internship. One was the analysis and simulation of side contracts against EIP-1559 in Ethereum, and the other was the design and implementation of cross-chain bridge protocols (the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560652) was accepted to ACM CCS 2022 and it's my first-ever publication).<br/>

  * I served as a reviewer for [IEEE JSAC Special Issue (Intelligent Blockchain) 2022](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-jsac/cfp/intelligent-blockchain-future-communications-and-networking) and reviewed 2 papers.<br/>

  * The list of published papers and their details is attached below.<br/>
