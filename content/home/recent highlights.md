  * #### RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

  * [Oct 2023] Representing Princeton University, our team (Princeton-1) ranked third place and won bronze medal in ICPC Greater New York Regional ([Live Stream Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imxmuXyOCY), [Event Website](http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/), [Final Scoreboard](http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/scoreboard_final/index.html)).
