In this project, we analyze the scenario where multiple self-interest-driven and myopic miners conduct selfish mining in Bitcoin system, through both simulation and theory. 

There're some interesting results, and you can refer to [the slides](https://zerui-cheng.com/uploads/multi-selfish-mining.pdf) for more details.
