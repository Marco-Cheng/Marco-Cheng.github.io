## Welcome to Zerui (Marco) Cheng's homepage~

The pronunciation of "Zerui" is similar to "the ray". You can also call me Marco instead :)



* #### **SHORT BIOGRAPHY**

  I’m a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton University fortunately advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath). My current research lies in the intersection of generative AI, blockchains, and mechanism design, with the goal of bringing advances of AI to the web3 world. <br/>

  <br/>

  

  Previously, I received B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) of IIIS, Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate journey, I was fortunate to be the recipient of [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) (the highest honor for a Yao Class student), Yao Class summa cum laude, and the Excellent Diploma Thesis Award of Tsinghua University.   <br/>

  <br/>

  

  I'm also an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements.  <br/><br/>

* #### RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

  * [Oct 2023] Representing Princeton University, our team (Princeton-1) ranked third place and won bronze medal in ICPC Greater New York Regional ([Live Stream Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imxmuXyOCY), [Event Website](http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/), [Final Scoreboard](http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/scoreboard_final/index.html)). It's a shame we didn't manage to bring the trophy back to Princeton by a narrow margin, but good news is that we advanced to the ICPC North America Championship 2024, and we'll come back stronger. See you in Orlando in May 2024!
    
  * [Aug 2023] Started my Ph.D. journey in  [Prof. Pramod Viswanath's research group](https://web3.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University!

  * [Jul 2023] The whitebook of our newly established decentralized AI platform [SAKSHI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562.pdf) is online now! 

  * [Jun 2023] Graduated from Yao Class, Tsinghua University with B.Eng. degree. I felt happy and excited to receive the Tsinghua University Excellent Diploma Thesis Award for my graduation dissertation (5 out of 94 are selected in Yao Class). And I also felt humbled to be awarded the Yao Class summa cum laude (23 out of 94 are selected in Yao Class).
  
  * [May 2023] Our paper [Crowdsourcing Work as Mining: A Decentralized Computation and Storage Paradigm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3600061.3603177) was accepted to APNet 2023! 
  
  * [Jan 2023] I‘m fortunate to be selected as a participant in this year's TV program <Super Brain: Season 10> on Jiangsu channel (broadcast at 21:10 every Friday, Beijing time). Stay tuned for my performance!
  
  * [Nov 2022] After serving as the vice president and deputy secretary for a year, I was grateful to be elected the president of Yao Class Students' Congress!
  
  * [Sep 2022] I felt honored and extremely excited to receive this year's [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) for my undergraduate achievements!
  
  * [Aug 2022] Our paper [zkBridge: Trustless Cross-chain Bridges Made Practical](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560652) was accepted to ACM CCS 2022! 
  
    
  
  



* #### **RESEARCH**

  * My research interests include blockchain, mechanism and incentive design, and applied cryptography.

  * Since sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/) to conduct scientific research on blockchain at Tsinghua University, and it's the initiation and enlightenment of my stepping into scientific research. During this period, I completed my first academic research paper: [Crowdsourcing Work as Mining: A Decentralized Computation and Storage Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669.pdf) .

  * I was fortunate to be invited to serve as a reviewer for [IEEE JSAC Special Issue (Intelligent Blockchain) 2022](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-jsac/cfp/intelligent-blockchain-future-communications-and-networking).

  * I was fortunate to be accepted as a research intern on blockchain in the spring and summer of 2022, advised by [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhang.me) at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I carried out research on two projects during the internship, one was the analysis and simulation of side contracts against EIP-1559 in Ethereum, and the other was the design and implementation of cross-chain bridge protocols (the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560652) was accepted to ACM CCS 2022 and it's my first-ever publication).

    

* #### **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING**

  * I am also an experienced and proud competitive programmer ([What is competitive programming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)).

  * Offline contests:  In high school, I was a two-time silver medalist of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (both in 2017 and 2018). During undergrad, representing Tsinghua University, I won a gold prize in ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Yinchuan Regional, a silver prize in ICPC East Asia Continental Final of, and 2 gold prizes in CCPC (Chinese Collegiate Programming Contest). For now, representing Princeton University, I won an overall third place and bronze medal in ICPC Greater New York Regional 2023 and advanced to ICPC North America Continental Championship 2024.

  * For online contests, I rank 16/182781 worldwide (and 2nd in China) on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) ([leaderboard here](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard)).  I also compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) ([see my profile here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marco_L_T)) and [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/) ([see my profile here](https://csacademy.com/user/Marco_L_T)).

  * Besides, I'm also an experienced problem setter for competitive programming contests. I have set and tested a number of problems for various contests. For example, I'm the main author of [Codeforces Round #447](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55858) ([problemset here](https://codeforces.com/contest/894)) and a problem setter of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021, and here is the problem I set([中文题面(original version in Chinese)](https://uoj.ac/problem/676), [English Translation](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/25068)). 

    

* #### **SOCIAL WORK**

  * I was gratefully elected and served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress at Tsinghua University for 2022-23 academic year, and I was the vice president and deputy secretary the year before.

  * I'm a member of the Algorithm Association at Tsinghua University. And I served as the problem setter and coordinator of a number of contests (including National Olympiad in Informatics (2021), Tsinghua University Programming Contest (2020, 2021, 2022)).

  * I was a volunteer for the 110th anniversary of Tsinghua University.

    

* #### AVOCATION

  * Fan of NBA, Formula 1, and European Soccer. My favorite sporting stars include Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors, NBA), Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes, F1), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari, F1), and Marco Reus (BVB Dortmund, Bundesliga). 
  
  * Amateur yet enthusiastic player of Geoguessr and HugeQuiz (especially in geography and sports).
  
  * Fan of stand-up comedies (including both Chinese-style cross-talk and American-style talk shows) and musicals. My favorite musicals include "Hamilton" and "Les Miserables".
  
  * Fan of music, especially those in musicals or in "Gu-Feng" (ancient Chinese) style.
  
  * I am also fond of playing basketball, although I don't have strong skills and can't often win a game :(
