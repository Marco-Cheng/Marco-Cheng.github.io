## Welcome to Zerui (Marco) Cheng's homepage~

The pronunciation of "Zerui" is similar to "the ray". You can also call me Marco instead :)



* #### **SHORT BIOGRAPHY**

  I’m a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton University, and my first-year academic advisor is [Prof. Maria Apostolaki](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/maria-apostolaki). My current research interests lie in an intersection of blockchains, web3 technologies, applied cryptography, and mechanism design.

  

  

  Previously, I received B.Eng. from the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) of IIIS, Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate journey, I was fortunate to be the recipient of [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) (the highest honor for a Yao Class student), Yao Class summa cum laude, and the Excellent Diploma Thesis Award of Tsinghua University. 

  

  

  I'm also an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements.

* #### **SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH**

  * My research interests include blockchain, mechanism and incentive design, and applied cryptography.

  * Since sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/) to conduct scientific research on blockchain at Tsinghua University, and it's the initiation and enlightenment of my stepping into scientific research. During this period, I completed [my first academic research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669.pdf) .

  * I was fortunate to be invited to serve as a reviewer for IEEE JSAC Special Issue (Intelligent Blockchain) 2022.

  * I was fortunate to be accepted as a research intern on blockchain in the spring and summer of 2022, advised by [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhang.me) at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I carried out research on two projects during the internship, one was the analysis and simulation of side contracts against EIP-1559 in Ethereum, and the other was the design and implementation of cross-chain bridge protocols (the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560652) was accepted to ACM CCS 2022 and it's my first-ever publication).

    

* #### **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING**

  * I am also an experienced and proud competitive programmer ([What is competitive programming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)), where I regard randomized algorithms and optimization of search algorithms as my most proficient skills. 

  * For offline contests, I have won a Gold Medal in ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Regional, a Silver Medal in ICPC East Asia Continental Final of, and 2 Gold Medals in CCPC (Chinese Collegiate Programming Contest). I'm also a two-time silver medalist of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (both in 2017 and 2018).

  * For online contests, I rank 16/182781 worldwide (and 2nd in China) on the well-reputed online programming platform [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and you can access the [leaderboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard) for more details.  I also compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) ([see my profile here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marco_L_T)) and [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/) ([see my profile here](https://csacademy.com/user/Marco_L_T)).

  * Besides, I'm also an experienced problem setter for competitive programming contests. I have set and tested a number of problems for various contests. For example, I'm the main author of [Codeforces Round #447](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55858) ([problemset here](https://codeforces.com/contest/894)) and a problem setter of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021. 

    

* #### **SOCIAL WORK**

  * I served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress at Tsinghua University for 2022-23 academic year, whereas I served as the vice president and deputy secretary for the 2021-22 academic year.

  * I'm a member of the Algorithm Association at Tsinghua University. And I served as the problem setter and coordinator of a number of contests (including National Olympiad in Informatics (2021), Tsinghua University Programming Contest (2020, 2021, 2022)).

  * I was a volunteer for the 110th anniversary of Tsinghua University.

    

* #### AVOCATION

  * Fan of NBA, Formula 1, and European Soccer. My favorite sporting stars include Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors, NBA), Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes, F1), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari, F1), and Marco Reus (BVB Dortmund, Bundesliga). 
  * Amateur yet enthusiastic player of Geoguessr and Sporcle (especially in geography and sports).
  * Fan of stand-up comedies (including both Chinese-style cross-talk and American-style talk shows) and musicals. My favorite musicals include "Hamilton" and "Les Miserables".
  * Fan of music, especially those in musicals or in "Gu-Feng" (ancient Chinese) style.
  * I am also fond of playing basketball, although I don't have strong skills and can't often win a game :(
