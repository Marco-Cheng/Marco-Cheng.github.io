## Welcome to Zerui Cheng's homepage~

  I’m a second-year Ph.D. student fortunately advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath) at Princeton University. My current research lies in the intersection of AI and blockchains, the two technologies which I believe will reshape our future society, with two main goals: **"AI for Blockchains"** to energize today's blockchains with advances in AI, **"Blockchains for AI"** to bring fairness and transparency to the era of AI. <br/> 
  
  I'm proud to have contributed in the following projects: <br/> 
  [Sentient](https://sentient.foundation/) , [zkBridge](https://www.zkbridge.com/) , [SAKSHI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562) , [PoCW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669).

  Previously, I received B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at Tsinghua University. During undergrad, I worked closely with [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/index.html), and I was fortunate to be the recipient of [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html), Yao Class summa cum laude, and the Excellent Diploma Thesis Award.  I was also grateful to be funded by Yao Class to visit [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://www.fanzhang.me/)'s research group at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)'s research group at the University of California, Berkeley as an intern in 2022. <br/>
