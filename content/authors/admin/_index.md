## Welcome to Zerui Cheng's homepage~

  I’m a second-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). I received B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://tsinghua.edu/) with the honor [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) and Yao Class summa cum laude. My current research lies in the intersection of AI and blockchains, exploring interdisciplinary methods for **AI agents to interact openly, fairly, and efficiently** , with a [first-principle approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle). <br/> 

  During undergraduate, I worked closely with [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/index.html). I was an intern at [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://www.fanzhang.me/)'s research group at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)'s research group at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022. <br/>

  <br/> 

  **Here are some of my spotlight projects:** ([Full paper list](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/#papers), [Full project list](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/#projects))<br/> 
  * **[Sentient](https://sentient.foundation/)**: A community-built Open AGI foundation via OML (Open, Monetizable, Loyal AI) ({{< staticref "uploads/OML_and_Sentient_Whitepaper.pdf" "newtab" >}}Link to OML Full Paper{{< /staticref >}}). Sentient has recently [raised an $85 million seed round](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/02/peter-thiels-founders-fund-leads-85m-seed-investment-into-open-source-ai-platform-sentient/);<br/> 
  * **[zkBridge](https://www.zkbridge.com/)**: Cross-chain bridges with zero-knowledge proofs ([Link to paper (CCS 2022)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3548606.3560652)). Its industrial realization, [PolyhedraZK, has a valuation of over $1 billion](https://www.theblock.co/post/282461/polyhedra-network-zkbridge-funding-1-billion-valuation-token-round);<br/> 
  * **[SAKSHI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562)**: A paradigm for decentralized AI platforms via PoI (Proof-of-Inference);<br/> 
  * **[PoCW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669)**: How to use the computation for AI model training as PoW in blockchains.<br/> 


  Besides, 
  * I'm an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements in OI/ICPC contests (both as contestant and problem setter).
  * I served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress in 2022-2023.
  * I was a participant of the TV show "Super Brain" (最强大脑 in Chinese) in 2023.
