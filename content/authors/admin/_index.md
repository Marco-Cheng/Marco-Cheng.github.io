## Welcome to Zerui Cheng's homepage~

  I’m a second-year Ph.D. student fortunately advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). My current research lies in the intersection of AI and blockchains, the two technologies which I believe will reshape our future society, with two main goals: **"AI for Blockchains"** to energize today's blockchains with advances in AI, **"Blockchains for AI"** to bring fairness and transparency to the era of AI. <br/> 
  
  I'm proud to have contributed in the following projects: <br/> 
  [Sentient](https://sentient.foundation/): A community-built Open AGI foundation via OML (Open, Monetizable, Loyal). Sentient has recently raised an $85 million seed round ([Source](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/02/peter-thiels-founders-fund-leads-85m-seed-investment-into-open-source-ai-platform-sentient/));<br/> 
  [zkBridge](https://www.zkbridge.com/): Cross-chain bridges made practical with state-of-the-art zero-knowledge proof protocols. Its industrial product, PolyhedraZK, has a valuation of over $1 billion as of Mar 2024 ([Source](https://www.theblock.co/post/282461/polyhedra-network-zkbridge-funding-1-billion-valuation-token-round));<br/> 
  [SAKSHI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562): A paradigm for decentralized AI platforms via PoI (Proof-of-Interence);<br/> 
  [PoCW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669): A paradigm that innovatively proposes to use the computation for AI model training / Crowdsourcing Work as PoW in blockchain consensus through PoCW mechanism (Proof-of-Crowdsourcing-Work).<br/> 

  Previously, I received B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://tsinghua.edu/). During undergrad, I worked closely with [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/index.html), and I was fortunate to be the recipient of [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html), Yao Class summa cum laude, and the Excellent Diploma Thesis Award.  I was also grateful to be funded by Yao Class to visit [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://www.fanzhang.me/)'s research group at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)'s research group at the University of California, Berkeley as an intern in 2022. <br/>
