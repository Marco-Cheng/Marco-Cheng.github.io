## Welcome to Zerui (Marco) Cheng's homepage~

The pronunciation of "Zerui" is similar to "the ray". You can also call me Marco instead :)



* #### **SHORT BIOGRAPHY**

  I’m an incoming Ph.D. student at Princeton University starting in Fall 2023. Previously, I received B.Eng. from the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) of IIIS, Tsinghua University. I was the recipient of [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) (the highest honor for a Yao Class student), Yao Class summa cum laude, and Tsinghua University excellent diploma thesis for my undergraduate achievements. 

  

  I enjoy learning and exploring the techniques and theories that can potentially have fantastic real-world impacts. My current research lies in an intersection of blockchain, applied cryptography, data processing and analysis, and mechanism design. 

  

  I'm also an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements.
