## Welcome to Zerui (Marco) Cheng's homepage~

The pronunciation of "Zerui" is similar to "the ray". You can also call me Marco instead :)



* #### **SHORT BIOGRAPHY**

  I’m a first-year Ph.D. student fortunately advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath) at Princeton. My current research lies in the intersection of generative AI, blockchains, and mechanism design, with the goal of bringing advances of AI to the web3 world. <br/>

  <br/>

  

  Previously, I received B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) of IIIS, Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate journey, I was fortunate to be the recipient of [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) (the highest honor for a Yao Class student), Yao Class summa cum laude, and the Excellent Diploma Thesis Award of Tsinghua University.   <br/>

  <br/>

  

  I'm also an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements.  <br/><br/>
