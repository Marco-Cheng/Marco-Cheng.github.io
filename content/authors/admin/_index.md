## Welcome to Zerui (Marco) Cheng's homepage~

The pronunciation of "Zerui" is similar to "the ray". You can also call me Marco instead :)



* #### **SHORT BIOGRAPHY**

  I’m a 4th-year undergraduate at the Honored [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) of IIIS, Tsinghua University, and the recipient of the highest honor [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) for my undergraduate achievements. I am a curious, proactive, and aspirant student with a broad range of research interests, especially the techniques and theories that can potentially have fantastic real-world impacts. My current research lies in an intersection of blockchain, applied cryptography, data processing and analysis, and mechanism design. I'm also an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements.

  

* #### RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

  * [Sep 2022] I felt honored and extremely excited to receive this year's [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) for my undergraduate achievements!
  
  * [Aug 2022] Our paper "zkBridge: Trustless Cross-chain Bridges Made Practical" was accepted to ACM CCS 2022! 
  
  * [Aug 2022] I participated in IC3 Blockchain Camp, and our group "Client Security" won 1st place in the Hackathon!
  
  * [Jun 2022] I participated in Google Code Jam 2022 and was happy to finish in the top 0.5% among all participants worldwide.
  
  * [May 2022] I served as the reviewer of 2 papers in IEEE JSAC Blockchain Special Issue.

  * My research interests include blockchain, mechanism and incentive design, and applied cryptography.
  
  * Since sophomore year, he has been advised by [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/) to conduct scientific research on blockchain at Tsinghua University, and it's the initiation and enlightenment of his stepping into scientific research. During this period, he completed his first academic research paper (on a framework linking crowdsourcing work to Proof-of-Work to serve as a new Proof-of-Useful-Work scheme) and it's in submission now.
  
  * He is fortunate to be invited to serve as a reviewer for IEEE JSAC Special Issue (Intelligent Blockchain) 2022.
  
  * He is fortunate to be accepted as a research intern on blockchain in the spring and summer of 2022, advised by [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhang.me) at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song ](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/)at the University of California, Berkeley. His research currently focuses on the analysis and simulation of side contracts in Ethereum, and the design and implementation of cross-chain bridge protocols.
  
    
  
* #### **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING**

  * He is also an experienced and proud competitive programmer ([What is competitive programming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)), where randomized algorithms and optimization of search algorithms are his most proficient skills. 
  
  * For offline contests, he has won a Gold Medal in ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Regional, a Silver Medal in ICPC East Continental Final of Asia, and two Gold Medals in CCPC (Chinese Collegiate Programming Contest). He is also a two-time silver medalist of Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (both in 2017 and 2018).
  
  * For online contests, he ranks 16/182781 worldwide (and 2nd in China) on the well-reputed online programming platform [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and you can access the [leaderboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard) for more details.  He also competes on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) ([see my profile here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marco_L_T)) and [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/) ([see my profile here](https://csacademy.com/user/Marco_L_T)).
  
  * Besides, he is also an experienced problem setter for competitive programming contests. He sets and tests a number of problems for various contests. For example, he is the main author of [Codeforces Round #447](https://codeforces.com/contest/894) and a problem setter of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021. 
  
    
  
* #### **SOCIAL WORK**
